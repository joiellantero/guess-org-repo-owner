# Guess Repo Owner

## Description
This script will quickly guess the repository based on the amount of contributions. The most number of contributions is assumed the owner of the repository.

I'm using the amount of contributions because the topic tags are not often used in an organization for repo identification and other info.

## Sample Use-Case (Cybersecurity)
This can be integrated to an incident management tool so that SOC and IR can quickly identify the contact for repositories with exposed secrets/credentials.
