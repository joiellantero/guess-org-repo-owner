# Guess Repo Owner

## Description
This script will quickly guess the repository owner based on the amount of contributions. The most number of contributions is assumed the owner of the repository. I'm using the amount of contributions because the topic tags are not often used in a GitHub organization for repo identification and other info.

The script will then query the employee name of the max contributor (GitHub username) from an autogenerated Markdown file by GitHub actions.

## Made for a Specific Use-Case (Cybersecurity)
This script is intended to be integrated to an incident management tool so that SOC and IR can quickly identify the contact for repositories with exposed secrets/credentials.

## Running in your Local Machine

1. create a `.env` file and put the necessary info, i.e., OWNER, REPOSITORY_NAME, ACCESS_TOKEN (GitHub API Access), USERS_REPO.
   > Replace all placeholder texts

    ```
    OWNER=placeholder_owner
    REPOSITORY_NAME=placeholder_repo_name
    ACCESS_TOKEN=placeholder_access_token_123
    USERS_REPO=placeholder/path/to/markdown_file.md
    ```

2. setup the Python environment (run the following commands)

    ```shell
    $ virtualenv env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python main.py
    ```
